lyso
--------------

lyso is a collection of tools for parsing and manipulation of common genomics file formats.

**PLEASE do not use lyso** for anything important or even as a reference for implementation. It is *incomplete*, *inefficient*, and *incorrect*!

lyso is solely my personal sandbox for messing around with these formats and for playing with [nom](https://docs.rs/nom/latest/nom/).

If you are in need of a serious library that is committed to conforming to the standards, see [noodles](https://github.com/zaeleus/noodles).
